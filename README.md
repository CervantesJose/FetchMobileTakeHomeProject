### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I chose to prioritize the professional implementation of the NetworkManager and ImageCacheFetcher as they were the core logic for this app.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent approximately 4 hours to follow outline of iOS_Interview_Guide.pdf and to showcase what I could get done in that time.
~2hrs on NetworkManager and ImageCacheFetcher
~1hr on Views
~1/2 hr on testing and code coverage
~1/2 hr on set up / clean up for turning in

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
Having focused on getting the correct logic and views to appear on screen, I think that deminished the amount of time I would have liked to spend on testing.
Before considering this done and raising a PR, I would have created mock protocols for network service and the image cache fetcher/url to add more testing scenarios.

### Weakest Part of the Project:
I think my weakest points in this project are Testing and the Detail View formatting.
Detail view was a quick addition at the end as to try and go beyond the requirements once I decided creating mock data for testing would take longer than the time I allocated to myself.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
Creating the ImageCacheFetcher for this project was the trickiest and most time consuming part as to follow requirements of not relying on any third-party solutions, URLSession's HTTP default cache setup, or the URLCache implementation.
Luckily for me, I had worked on something similar when reviewing my HWS projects I worked on for studying SwiftUI.
I hope I was able to demonstrate the ability to follow directions, meet requirements, and effective communication in this project.
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated and I look forward to next steps.
